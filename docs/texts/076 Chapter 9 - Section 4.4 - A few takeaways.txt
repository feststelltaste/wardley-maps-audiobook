Chapter 9 - Section 4.4.: A few takeaways

   By now I’ve hopefully given you a basic introduction into anticipation. This is a topic that is worthy of its own book and there are many methods and techniques to be used here. However, as with the whole cycle of strategy this is an area which you will refine with practice, learning of climatic patterns and understanding of the landscape. Using a map enables you to discuss your anticipation of change with others and allow for that all important challenge. There are still lots of areas of uncertainty but with practice you’ll find yourself embracing that uncertainty and using mechanisms that exploit it. I’ve covered quite a bit in this chapter but there are some key points I’d like you remember.
