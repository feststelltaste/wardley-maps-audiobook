Chapter 9 - Section 4.5.: Climatic patterns

     * Not everything is random. Somethings are predictable over when or what or both.
     * The future value of something is inversely proportional to the certainty we have over it. As the predictability of a component increases with evolution, so does its ubiquity and hence there is a corresponding decline in differential value.
     * Components can co-evolve e.g. practice with activities.
     * The economy has cycles e.g. peace, war and wonder. We’re now halfway through our list of climatic patterns. I’ve marked them off in figure 111 in orange. PS. I like orange. My car is an orange Mini. I told you I was a fairly normal person. Anyway, read through the list and make sure you’re comfortable with them. We’re going to be relying on these later.

See    Figure 111: Climatic patterns
 for more details.
   We’ve also added in a type of Gameplay in the use of weak signals which can help refine anticipation.
