Chapter 6 - Section 6.: An exercise for the reader

   There’s a lot of things I could recommend here. Obviously top of my list is practice mapping within your organisation. I’d also spend some time with the books above.

   However, can I also strongly recommend that you go and play World of Warcraft if you have any doubts over the importance of situational awareness. I understand that Fernando Flores (former Finance Minister and Senator for the Chilean Government) runs an executive training course on this. I know it sounds daft but where better to learn how to play games than in a game?

   In the next section of six chapters, I’m going to cover my Wilderness years and the formalisation of mapping as we loop around the strategy cycle again.
