Chapter 11 - Section 4.: Mastering strategy as simply as I can

   We’ve covered a lot of ground in these chapters, so I thought in this final sections I’d recap some of the basics on how to master strategy. You’ll need this for the scenario. I’ve italicised master because I don’t really have a clue how to do that. I’m still learning and I’ve been using maps for over a decade. For now, all I can say is that strategy seems to be a journey of constant learning and the more I learn, the more I realise how little I know. If anyone does actually become a master then I’d be pleased to read about how they did it. There maybe a faster way to master strategy than a seemingly endless journey of learning. There might even be a 2x2 that’ll explain everything but so far, I haven’t found it. Hence in the absence of some marvellous solution, I’ll give you some basic steps.
