Chapter 19 - Section 4.: Finding a balance

   Whether it’s finding opportunities (i.e. stepping stones that expand your future possibilities), using policy to change the game rather than just technology or whether it’s the flows of capital within a system and how we account for or purchase it — these are all elements which we use in gameplay. There is also the issue of balance within the system i.e. inertia is both a good thing in terms of keeping you from industrialising an industry too early but a disaster if you haven’t effectively managed it when an industry is industrialising. In the same manner, an investment in some form of capital asset can rapidly become a liability as the space evolves. As you develop, you’ll learn to keep all of this in balance.

   The maps themselves can help guide you but you’ll need to scenario plan around them. There are rarely simple answers. In the next chapters, we’re going to start going through a long list of specific patterns of play before we come back and break down an entire industry. To prepare you, I’ve listed the general forms of gameplay in figure 250. I’ve organised the table by broad category i.e. user perception, accelerators, de-accelerators, dealing with toxicity, market impacts, defensive, attacking, ecosystem, competitor, positional and poison. Each of the following chapters will deal with a single category (eleven chapters in total) using maps and where possible examples to demonstrate the play. By now, you’re probably ready and dangerous enough to start playing chess with companies or at least start learning how to do so.
