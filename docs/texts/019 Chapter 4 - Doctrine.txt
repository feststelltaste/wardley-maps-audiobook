Chapter 4 - Doctrine

   I had created my first map and applied an understanding of some basic climatic patterns that might influence it. These patterns were the ones that I could not stop but I could anticipate. Whether I liked it or not the components on my map would evolve through the actions of the market. However, whilst I had no choice over the market that didn’t mean I had no choice over my actions. I might be able to influence the landscape through action, I could decide how I organised myself, the principles that I emphasised within the company and our manner of operating.

   Some of my choices might be context specific i.e. a decision to flank an opponent requires an opponent to be in a known position. This doesn’t mean that everything is context specific. There could exist in business generally useful principles that everyone should apply. These principles are doctrine and in this chapter we’re going to examine that part of my journey — see figure 29.
