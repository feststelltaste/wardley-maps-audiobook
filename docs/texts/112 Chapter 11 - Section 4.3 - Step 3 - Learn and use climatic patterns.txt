Chapter 11 - Section 4.3.: Step 3 — Learn and use climatic patterns

   Once you have a map, then you can start to learn the next part of the strategy cycle i.e. climatic patterns. In business maps, these are the common economic patterns that effect all players and can be considered the rules of the game. Use those patterns to try and anticipate where the market is heading. The more you play, the more rules you’ll discover. It’s really important that before you start trying to organise and structure yourself (i.e. apply doctrine) that you look at where the market is going and not where it has been. No-one ever wins by building the perfect structure for the past. We’ve covered a pretty extensive number of the basic economic patterns but as I reminder, I’ll list them adding a few more flourishes where needed.
