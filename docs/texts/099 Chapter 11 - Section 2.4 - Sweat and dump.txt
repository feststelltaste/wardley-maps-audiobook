Chapter 11 - Section 2.4.: Sweat and dump

   A variation of the approach is to deliberately sweat the legacy (i.e. minimise investment) whilst you build the new world. In the case of cloud, this is where enterprise cloud services might have some benefit. By shifting a legacy environment to an “enterprise cloud” provider with minimal architectural changes then you move any responsibility for capex investment to the provider. You sweat the legacy whilst preparing a new environment with components that you have built or use from third parties. What you want is for the “enterprise cloud” service to provide utility based charging with no long term contract. Despite the empty words you might have given the provider regarding long term future, when you are ready you unceremoniously start dumping the legacy. By such an approach you’re shifting future capex investment to the provider and reducing this cost for yourself. This method is unlikely to make you friends with the provider so plan accordingly.
