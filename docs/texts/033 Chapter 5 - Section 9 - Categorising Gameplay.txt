Chapter 5 - Section 9.: Categorising Gameplay

   Gameplay is context specific. You need to understand the landscape before you use it. The purpose of gameplay is once you determine the possible “wheres” that you could attack (which requires you to understand landscape and anticipate change from common economic patterns) then you look at what actions you can take to create the most advantageous situation. As we go through this book, we will cover all sorts of gameplay and refine the concepts discussed above. To give you an idea of what we need to cover, I’ve put some basic forms in figure 59, marking off in orange some that we’ve already mentioned.
See    Figure 59: Gameplay
 for more details.
   I’ve categorised the above forms of gameplay depending upon their main impact :     * Alteration of user perception
     * Accelerators to evolution
     * De-accelerators to evolution
     * Means of dealing with toxicity (i.e. legacy)
     * Market plays
     * Defensive plays
     * Attacking plays
     * Ecosystem models
     * Positional plays
     * Poison mechanisms (prevents a competitor using the space)

   I have to reiterate that every time that I’ve gone around the cycle, I’ve got better at playing the game. As we travel along the same path I’ll be adding in more economic patterns, more doctrine and more context specific gameplay along with deep diving on some of the parts I’ve glossed over or were merely general concepts in those early days. But as with all journeys, let us stick to the path and no short cutting. Every step is valuable; every landscape is an opportunity to learn from.
