Chapter 7 - Section 5.3.: Climate : Evolution

     * You cannot measure evolution over time or adoption.
     * Evolution is measured over ubiquity versus certainty. The “ubiquitous” market for one activity (e.g. smartphones) is not necessarily the same as the “ubiquitous” market for another (e.g. gold bars).
     * Evolution consists of multiple diffusion curves. Evolution and diffusion are connected but separate concepts. Don’t confuse the two.
     * Evolution is driven by supply and demand competition.
     * Whilst we cannot say when things will happen (we can cheat with weak signal analysis), we can describe what will happen i.e. this will evolve to more of a commodity. Evolution shows you a path but there is no crystal ball to predicting the future. We have to embrace uncertainty. The less evolved something is (i.e. the less certain we are about it, see figure 71) then by definition the more uncertain it becomes.
     * The idea of evolution is itself evolving and is therefore uncertain. All models are wrong, some are merely useful. I’ve marked off the list of climatic patterns that we’ve covered so far in orange in figure 82. Before long we will be anticipating change like a professional.
