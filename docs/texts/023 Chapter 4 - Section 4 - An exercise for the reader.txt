Chapter 4 - Section 4.: An exercise for the reader

   In [59]chapter 3 I asked you to apply some basic economic patterns to a map you created in [60]chapter 2. If you’ve been skipping these exercises then now is the time to go back and complete them. Mapping isn’t something you can just read and become an expert in , it’s something you have to apply and learn.

   I want you to now take your map and look at the various forms of doctrine highlighted in figure 44. Try and work with others and apply them to your map. Are you thinking about user needs? Are you challenging your assumptions? How would you organise yourself? Do you know the details?
