Chapter 11 - A smorgasbord of the slightly


   “Here’s one I made earlier” is the staple diet of TV programmes when faced with the possibility that something might go wrong. Demonstrations are always a risky business. In the case of this book, doubly so. I want to let you loose on a scenario but alas I’m not even there to correct things if it all goes pear shaped. To manipulate the odds slightly in my favour of a beneficial result then before we get to the scenario (chapters 12 and 13), I’m going to cover some aspects of mapping in a little more detail. This is somewhat naughty because these ideas being fresh in your mind are likely to create a bias which is exactly what I’m hoping for. I’m signposting the answer before we’ve even got there. It’s the closest I could get to “Here’s one I made earlier” without writing down the answer first .

   However, to make the exercise still challenging then I’ve taking the liberty of hiding the clues throughout this chapter which is interspersed with lots of useful but not directly relevant concepts in a smorgasbord of the slightly useful. The concepts we will examine are on the opportunity of change, the trouble with contracts, common lies we tell ourselves and how to master strategy.
