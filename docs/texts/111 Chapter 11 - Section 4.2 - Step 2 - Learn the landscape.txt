Chapter 11 - Section 4.2.: Step 2 — Learn the landscape

   Your next step is to observe the game i.e. to look at the landscape — figure 157. This is essential for you to be able to learn about the game, to communicate with others and to anticipate change. To observe the landscape you must have a map of its context. Any map must have the basic characteristics of : being visual, context specific (i.e. to the game at hand including the pieces involved), position of pieces relative to some anchor (in geographical maps this is the compass, in chess it is the board itself) and movement (i.e. how things can change, the constraint of possibilities). In business, extremely few companies have maps and so don’t worry too much about where others are going or grand proclamations that they might make.
See    Figure 157: Build a map
