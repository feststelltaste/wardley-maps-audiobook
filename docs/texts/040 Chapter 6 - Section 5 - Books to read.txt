Chapter 6 - Section 5.: Books to read

   Alas, I haven’t found any books that deal with topographical intelligence in business (i.e. the use of maps and situational awareness) which is why after almost eight years of badgering I’m finally getting around to writing one. I’m a very reluctant writer and hopefully someone will take this and write a better book. That said, there are lots of other books that I’d recommend reading because of the general concepts they provide. I don’t necessarily agree with everything they state but these are definitely worth exploring. I find all of these books are worth spending time with.
