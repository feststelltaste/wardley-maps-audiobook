Chapter 15 - Section 6.: Your choice

   You have the map, the background and the financial models. You need to consider the landscape, the roles involved, your role and what’s the best way to play this game. Once you’ve signed the contract then the company will be taking the risk and paying for an early stage investment. That early stage investment may significantly rise depending upon which outcome starts to emerge.
   Given everything you’ve been told, you now need to decide:      * Do you sign the contract or not?
     * If you do sign which variant do you go for (in-house or public)?
     * Are there any other changes that you would make?
