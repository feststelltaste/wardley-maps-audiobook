Chapter 7 - Section 5.1.: Purpose, Scope and Imperative

     * Purpose, scope, moral imperative, survival and user needs can be connected in a chain of needs.
     * All will evolve and be effected by the chain they exist within. Nothing is permanent.
     * Scope should be tangible and easy to understand but you also need a moral imperative to enthuse people.
     * Aim to create revenue and profit — your need to survive — by meeting your users’ needs.
     * There is often a balancing act between different conflicting user needs.
