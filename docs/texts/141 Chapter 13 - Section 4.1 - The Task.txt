Chapter 13 - Section 4.1.: The Task

   You have a call in forty-five minutes with the executive board. That’s how long you have to make your choices. The clock is ticking. So find a stopwatch and start it.

   Your first task is to determine whether the company is heading in the right direction. You should determine whether you agree with the priority order given in figure 180. If not, write down what your priority order would be. If you decide to invoke “other” then scribble down what that other is.
See    Figure 180: Priority order
 for more details.
   Once you’ve decided your priority order then your next task is to determine what you’re going to say to the executive board.
