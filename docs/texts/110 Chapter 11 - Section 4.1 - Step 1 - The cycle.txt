Chapter 11 - Section 4.1.: Step 1 — The cycle

   Understand that strategy is a continuous cycle. You don’t have all the information you need, you don’t know all the patterns and there are many aspects of life that are uncertain. Fortunately not all is uncertain. Start with a direction (i.e. a why of purpose, as in “I wish to win this game of chess”) but be prepared to adapt as the game unfolds (i.e. the why of movement, as in “should I move this chess piece or that one?”). Your first step on the journey is to understand the cycle of strategy — figure 156. Lots of people can help you here from John Boyd (OODA loops) to Sun Tzu (art of war).
See    Figure 156: The strategy cycle
 for more details.
