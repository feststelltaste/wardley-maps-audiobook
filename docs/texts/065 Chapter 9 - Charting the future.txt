Chapter 9 - Charting the future


   Most people don’t have a desire to learn mapping for the sake of it. Instead, what people are looking for is a way to create advantage either through learning of context specific play (i.e. outsmarting others), the application of doctrine (i.e. being more effectively organised than others) or anticipation of change (i.e. seeing change before others). Back in early 2008, I had become quite a dab hand at using maps and common economic changes (i.e. climatic patterns) to anticipate change in business. I was regularly invited to speak at huge events and published articles in which I would declare that over the next decade we would see :     * Rapid increases in the rate at of innovation on the web.
     * New entrants dominating IT
     * High rates of disruption in the IT markets
     * Radical changes in IT practices.
     * Higher levels of efficiency within IT.
     * Widespread adoption of cloud services.
     * Increasing organisational strain especially focused on IT creating a necessity for organisational change.

   I was often greeted with a few gasps of wonder and a cacophony of derision and dismissal. I think I’ve been tagged with every label from “idiot” to “rubbish” to “gibberish” to “unrealistic”. The most vociferous insults came from the world of established vendors, enterprises, analysts and strategy consultants who had oodles of inertia to such changes. Fortunately, the gasps of wonder were enough to pick up some advisory work and keep booking a few gigs.

   I need to be clear. I don’t have mystical powers of anticipation, a time machine, some great intellect or a crystal ball. In fact, I’m a lousy prognosticator and a very normal sort of person. My “predictions” were all sleight of hand. What I’m good at is taking pre-existing patterns that are in the wild and repeating them back to everyone. It’s more of the “I predict that the ball you’ve thrown in the air will fall to the ground” or the “I predict the general currently ordering troops to ‘walk off the cliff’ will lose the battle” kind. A basic understanding of the landscape and climatic patterns can be used to remarkable effect with an audience of executives that lacks this. To begin our journey into anticipation we’re going to have to start with areas of predictability.
